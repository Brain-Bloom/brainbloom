But it's the Internet that makes them come alive, allowing users to communicate and share data all across the world, over millions of miles, in fractions of a second. The Internet forms the connection underlying all computing, governing how software and hardware\u2014regardless of vendor\u2014work together. Here Doug Winnie explains the history of the Internet and the technology underlying the web, including IP addressing, routing, web servers, URLs, and the languages that allow computers to \"speak\" to each other over the Internet, such as hypertext and HTML. And any conversation about the Internet isn't complete without a mention of security. Doug explains how encryption works and why it's important to keeping your data safe online.\n\nThis course is the second in our series, designed around the AP Computer Science Principles (CSP) curriculum. It is a great foundation for anyone, at any age, to prepare for careers in technology and computer science. Understanding basics like the Internet will help you understand the interplay between hardware, software, data, networks, and the people that use them.",

Often, however, you practice compassion in the most unpleasant of moments, like when you have to give someone devastating, life-changing news. Compassion can often encompass seemingly opposite emotions, like when you feel upset but also feel love, or sadness mixed with gratitude. Given that this kind of sympathetic awareness often evokes seemingly paradoxical emotions and reactions, a key to understanding how people react compassionately lies in the science of compassion. Specifically, what happens in your body when you feel compassion? In this installment of series, Kelly McGonigal examines the physical changes in your body\u2014what it looks like in your brain, in your nervous system, and your physical, pounding heart\u2014as compassion unfolds. Perhaps most importantly, she considers how understanding the biology of compassion can help you engage with suffering.\n\nThis course was created by Sounds True.
